The cookie looks like this:\n\n```\npickup=Subject=\u0026PackageID=MTU4NDgzMTU=███\n```\n\nIf an attacker can generate this cookie, this allows downloading a file. As it turns out, the generation of the cookie is fairly straightforward and requires no server-side key, only a file ID and its associated password. The components are:\n\n1. The file ID, base 64 encoded, followed by a dash\n2. The SHA512 hash of the plaintext file ID, base 64 encoded\n3. The secret key of the package (as sent in the email), base 64 encoded, followed by a dash\n4. The SHA2512 hash of the secret key, base 64 encoded\n\nBy generating a cookie using this format, an attacker can accomplish the following:\n\n1. Bypass CAC-enforced files.\n2. Bypass deleted files (tested when a user deletes their package). Untested if this allows accessing historical files.\n3. Bypass \"locked\" files that have already been downloaded.\n\nFor instance, after attempting to download a deleted package on █████, █████ displays the following error:\n\n\u003e The package Is no longer available For download. The file(s) has been permanently deleted from ███████. You will have To contact the sender And ask them To upload the file(s) again. \n\nHowever, this is not true. By making a crafted request to `/█████████/Download.aspx` given the above cookies, a user can still download deleted files. This may also apply to past files, meaning that all previous uploaded files may not be deleted. I will test this when files I have submitted expire.\n\n## Impact\n\nSignificant bypasses to █████████ security controls, including:\n\n- Bypass CAC protections\n- Download files that ███ says have been deleted from the file system\n- Download locked files that have already been downloaded\n\nIt is unclear at the moment if this also applies to files that have expired after a set period of time. I will retest when files I have uploaded have expired.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Visit https://███████/██████/pickupfiles.aspx?id=15849581, a file I uploaded and deleted.\n2. Try the password `█████████`. Observe that an error is displayed that the file is deleted.\n3. As described above, generate the following cookie, based on the file ID and password.\n\n```\npickup=Subject=\u0026PackageID=MTU4NDk1ODE=█████████\n```\n\n4.
