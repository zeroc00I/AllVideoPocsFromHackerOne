It was found that if an attacker sends login requests faster than every 4 seconds from the same IP address, it would get blocked. This still allows an attacker to make the following number of guesses from one single system: 15/minute, 900/hour, 21.600/day or 648.000/month. No additional protection mechanism such as Captcha (pre-auth) or account lockout requiring additional email/phone verification (pre- or post-auth) were identified at any time. This allows for brute-forcing of credentials, for example based on breached clear-text password databases of which there are many publicly available (https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords).\n\nAdditionally, rate-limitation nowadays is not effective anymore to protect against brute-force. There are many botnets out there which can be used to overcome this hurdle, as well as cloud (VPS) services (e.g. Amazon AWS EIPs, DigitalOcean, ...), VPNs, proxies and the like.

This effectively overcomes the IP-rate limiting and allows a full-fleged online brute-force attack at virtually unlimited speeds.

After this script guessed wrongly more than 10.000 times, the successful password was found and I could simply login to hackerone.com with my test account and this password, without any additional validation whatsoever. \n\nOne example of a similar vulnerability that was exploited by Black Hats in the past would be Apple's Celebgate scandal of January 2015, where celebrity passwords were brute-forced through an unprotected Apple authentication endpoint. In the case of HackerOne, this could lead to the compromise of many accounts, since it is a well-known fact that people tend to choose similar passwords which turn up in dictionaries. Indirectly, it might grant unauthorized access to confidential bug descriptions to a successful attacker.\n\nFor more info, see http://www.imperva.com/docs/WP_Consumer_Password_Worst_Practices.pdf . A password analysis study of the 32-million clear-text password leak of the Rockyou website breach revealed that by guessing the topmost 4655 passwords in this dump against all users, an attacker would gain access to around 20% of all accounts (page 4). That would be a lot of HackerOne accounts.\n\nRecommendation: Implement a Captcha after a reasonable number of failed login attempts against one account at the application-layer. The Captcha should not only be shown to offending IP addresses, but to anyone who attempts to login to the account under attack. Another option is to enable an account lockout policy which effectively locks down an account that has been attacked (e.g. after 20 failed consecutive logins) and requires out-of-band validation by the real account owner (e.g. email, mobile) before becoming accessible again. \n\nBest regards,\n\nArne Swinnen\nhttps://www.arneswinnen.net\n\n\n\n","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eDear,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour web authentication endpoint, \u003ca title=\"https://hackerone.com/sessions\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/sessions\"\u003ehttps://hackerone.com/sessions\u003c/a\u003e (POST), currently protects against credentials brute-force attacks only by requests rate-limiting based on IP.

In the case of HackerOne, this could lead to the compromise of many accounts, since it is a well-known fact that people tend to choose similar passwords which turn up in dictionaries. Indirectly, it might grant unauthorized access to confidential bug descriptions to a successful attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more info, see \u003ca title=\"http://www.imperva.com/docs/WP_Consumer_Password_Worst_Practices.pdf\" href=\"/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imperva.com%2Fdocs%2FWP_Consumer_Password_Worst_Practices.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttp://www.imperva.com/docs/WP_Consumer_Password_Worst_Practices.pdf\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e . A password analysis study of the 32-million clear-text password leak of the Rockyou website breach revealed that by guessing the topmost 4655 passwords in this dump against all users, an attacker would gain access to around 20% of all accounts (page 4). That would be a lot of HackerOne accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecommendation: Implement a Captcha after a reasonable number of failed login attempts against one account at the application-layer. The Captcha should not only be shown to offending IP addresses, but to anyone who attempts to login to the account under attack. Another option is to enable an account lockout policy which effectively locks down an account that has been attacked (e.g. after 20 failed consecutive logins) and requires out-of-band validation by the real account owner (e.g. email, mobile) before becoming accessible again. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBest regards,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eArne Swinnen\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca title=\"https://www.arneswinnen.net\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arneswinnen.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://www.arneswinnen.net\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","bounty_amount":"1500.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,500","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication -

Great to hear you are taking steps to solve this issue. \n\nCoincidentally, I saw the following new [recaptcha bypass](www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/07/captcha_rapture_as_google_facebook_humancheckers_wasted/) pass by today. The original research was presented at [Black Hat Asia 2016](https://www.blackhat.com/asia-16/briefings.html#im-not-a-human-breaking-the-google-recaptcha) in the beginning of April, apparently. The article mentions \"Google has hardened its CAPTCHA services against the described attack\", without any additional details.\n\nIn general I think you're good with recaptcha, but if you're completely paranoid, you might in addition implement an account lockout which gets triggered after e.g. 20 consecutive failed login attempts *with a Captcha*. But again, only if you're completely paranoid :). A decent Captcha such as recaptcha would already protect HackerOne sufficiently in my opinion. But you can never fully trust this kind of security control, as the aforementioned article proves. \n\nCheers,\n\nArne ","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for the heads up.
