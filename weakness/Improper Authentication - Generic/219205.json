The root cause of this authentication bypass is two-fold:\n\n1. Subdomain saostatic.uber.com was pointing to Amazon Cloudfront CDN, but the hostname was not registered there anymore. This allowed me to fully takeover this domain. It is now serving content of my own webserver, both over http and https (highly similar to [175070](https://hackerone.com/reports/175070) - however, I must disagree with \"there are some mitigating factors (cookie scope) that make this not as bad as it might appear at first blush.\"). \n2. Your SSO system at auth.uber.com issues session cookies which are temporarily shared between all https://*.uber.com subdomains through its \"domain=.uber.com\" attribute. Although there were some countermeasures to prevent theft, the current setup still allows leakage of these high-value session cookies to the overtaken subdomain https://saostatic.uber.com in all modern browsers, leading to a full Authentication Bypass (highly similar to [172137](https://hackerone.com/reports/172137)).\n\n## Security Impact\nThe security impact of the subdomain takeover is that Uber can be impersonated via this webpage. A valid SSL certificate could easily be generated for this domain via Let's Encrypt, which would make it ideal for e.g. phishing attacks. \n\nThe security impact of the SSO system using shared session cookies for https://*.uber.com is, in combination with the subdomain takeover vulnerability, an Authentication Bypass via session hijacking. A victim must be authenticated to auth.uber.com and then visit a webpage under the attacker's control to be exploited successfully - no further interaction is required from the victim, the attack can be performed stealthily without the user noticing or being notified by Uber. The end result is that the attacker can now impersonate the victim on any of the *.uber.com which rely on auth.uber.com for authentication, such as riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com, developer.uber.com, bonjour.uber.com, etc. \n\n# 1. Subdomain Takeover\n\nThe subdomain \"saostatic.uber.com\" was (and still is) a CNAME pointing to a AWS Cloudfront CDN server (depending on your location, the latter will resolve differently):\n```\n# nslookup saostatic.uber.com 8.8.8.8\nServer:\t\t8.8.8.8\nAddress:\t8.8.8.8#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nsaostatic.uber.com\tcanonical name = d3i4yxtzktqr9n.cloudfront.net.\n```\nHowever, the hostname \"saostatic.uber.com\" was not claimed anymore on Cloudfront, resulting in a Cloudfront error page when visiting the subdomain before the takeover:\n\n{F173887}\n\nSubsequently, a new Amazon Cloudfront CDN endpoint was created and linked to an attacker-controlled origin server. For the new Cloudfront CDN endpoint, \"saostatic.uber.com\" was designated as hostname successfully:\n\n{F173885}\n\nThis concluded the subdomain takeover. Visual proof can be found at http://saostatic.uber.com/subdomaintakeoverbyarneswinnen.html (unguessable filename chosen to not negatively affect Uber's reputation during takeover period) :\n\n {F173884}\n\n#2. Authentication Bypass\n\nIn Uber's SSO system, auth.uber.com acts as Identity Provider and issues temporarily shared session cookies for https://*.uber.com to communicate identities to Service Providers (e.g. riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com, etc). Service Providers on their end immediately destroy the incoming temporary shared session cookies in case of erroneous (e.g. issued for other Service Provider) or successful authentication, ensuring the window for theft is small:\n\n {F202679}\n\nThe precious shared session cookie \"_csid\" can thus only be stolen between step 9 and 10, which is a very short period (automatic browser redirect). Although not impossible to exploit, a more convenient flaw was identified that allows the shared session cookie to remain alive after step 9 in the browser's cookie store in the diagram above. The issue is that, if the victim is already logged in at https://riders.uber.com (situation after last step 12 in diagram) when receiving a request containing a valid newly generated shared session cookie \"_csid\", it is simply ignored. Hence it stays alive in the browser until its cookie store is cleared. An attacker simply needs to directly issue another login scenario starting from step 3 in the above diagram, and end with an additional hidden request to https://saostatic.uber.com to steal the precious session cookie:\n\n{F202676}\n\nSo now an attacker has his/her hands on the victim's \"_csid\" shared session cookie for https://riders.uber.com, he/she can execute the normal login flow in their own browser and replace the issued \"_csid\" cookie value in step 9 of the first Uber SSO Login diagram to be logged in as the victim, right? Wrong. There's another countermeasure in place, namely a variant of login cross-site request forgery protection. This is the actual updated Uber SSO Login 2 diagram:\n\n{F202678}\n\nThe problem here are the GET param state=CSRFTOKEN and locally scoped state cookie that are added in step 3 by the Service Provider riders.uber.com and verified in step 11. Since we can't steal these values from the victim's browser, but only the \"_csid\" shared session cookie, this means game over, right?\n\nNo! An attacker can obtain a proper CSRFTOKEN value and accompanying state cookie value from https://riders.uber.com by starting a normal login scenario on their end (e.g. in their own browser or via a simple script). He/she can then relay the auth.uber.com URL to the victim's browser to get the \"_csid\" shared session cookie for these values, and inject these in his/her own browser login scenario again in step 9. In this manner, the victim effectively generates the \"_csid\" temporary session token for the attacker's login scenario in a separate browser, but this works flawlessly. This still allows exploitation and thus victim impersonation in the following manner (we still assume that the victim is already logged in to auth.uber.com and visits a webpage under control by the attacker, so we basically continue the flow from the above third and last diagram): \n\n{F202677}\n\n# PoC\n\nIn the PoC below, the assumption is made that https://saostatic.uber.com is actually serving a valid certificate in the victim's browser, which currently is not the case (so there is currently no actual exposed risk). I figured you might not appreciate that. \n\n1. Open the victim's browser \u0026 browse to https://riders.uber.com . After being redirected to https://auth.uber.com , login with the victim's credentials so you end up on https://riders.uber.com trips dashboard again.\n2. Open a second browser tab in the victim's browser and browse to https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php . Accept any certificate warnings that you may receive here - again, we're only simulating that the domain has a valid SSL certificate. Once the page has finished loading you should see a URL, \"Cookie: \" string and a \"Set-Cookie: \" strings underneath each other. This is all info gathered under the hood by the attacker's webserver that is required to login as the victim now.\n3. Open the separate attacker's browser and setup an intercepting proxy tool to intercept requests and responses. Browse to the URL displayed on the prepareuberattack.php page output and intercept this request. Now copy the \"Cookie: ...\" string displayed on prepareuberattack.php and paste it into the request headers. \n4. The response should be a redirect to https://riders.uber.com/trips, indicating successful authentication bypass. Last but not least, copy all the \"Set-Cookie: \" lines from the prepareuberattack.php page output and paste them in the response before forwarding it to the browser. This ensures that the stolen cookies are properly injected in the attacker's browser. \n5. You are now logged in as the victim in the attacker's browser \n\nIn a real attack scenario, an attacker would stealthily load https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php in the victim's browser, e.g. through an iframe. Likewise, he/she would probably not display the URL and all the cookies on the PHP page, but store this on the server-side, ready to be abused in a stealthy fashion. \n\nYou can see all these PoC steps executed in attachment \"8. Authentication Bypass PoC video.mp4\", where browser 1 and browser 2 had separate upstream servers and thus even other IP addresses to prove this is a plausible threat. The code of the https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php and https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php pages is also attached (\"9. prepareuberattack.php\" and \"10. uberattack.php\"). This was written quick \u0026 dirty for PoC purposes - I know the code is pretty hacky.\n\n# Recommendations\n1. The recommendation for the subdomain takeover is straightforward: remove the dangling DNS CNAME pointer to Amazon CloudFront and the issue is resolved.\n2. The recommendation for the generic Authentication Bypass issue is a bit more problematic. The fact that identities supplied to Service Providers by the Identity Provider are communicated via shared *.uber.com cookies make them susceptible for all vulnerabilities that allows insight in cookies on any *.uber.com subdomain. This includes remote code execution, subdomain takeover,  debug logs, etc and has a very serious impact on Uber's overall security, even when the subdomain is hosted in a completely isolated environment. \nFor example, all the mentioned out of scope *.uber.com subdomains in the program's listing (bizblog.uber.com, newsroom.uber.com etc) have the inherent ability to bypass authentication of any Uber user, even though they might be remotely managed by an external party with lower security standards than Uber. Ironically enough, any service that wants to benefit from the current Uber SSO system will have to receive a *.uber.com subdomain, as this is required by design. This in its turn increases the attack surface for abuse of the generic Authentication Bypass. \nOn the short term I would recommend fixing the fact that the \"_csid\" cookie can remain alive in a browser once a user is already logged in (although [Jack Whitton already showed that CSP could be abused to prevent a victim to make the request back to the Service Provider and invalidate the token](https://whitton.io/articles/uber-turning-self-xss-into-good-xss/), so I wouldn't put too much trust in that). On the mid-to-long term I would advise Uber to migrate to a real OAuth SSO system that communicates identity secrets and proofs by other means than shared cookies, e.g. GET parameters (OAuth \"code\" flow) or window.location.hash values (e.g. OAuth \"access tokens\" flow). \n\nLet me know if anything is unclear.\n\nCheers,\n\nArne Swinnen\nhttps://www.arneswinnen.net","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not a standard vulnerability, but a chain of two more exotic vulnerabilities leading to a full authentication bypass of your SSO login system at auth.uber.com (via saostatic.uber.com).

This still allows exploitation and thus victim impersonation in the following manner (we still assume that the victim is already logged in to auth.uber.com and visits a webpage under control by the attacker, so we basically continue the flow from the above third and last diagram): \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"markdown-attachment-link markdown-attachment-inline-reference\" data-attachment-filename=\"Uber-SSO-Attack-2.png\" data-attachment-link=\"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/202/677/c44875a3e29f210f07cd737b9cbb377a7d94ec44/Uber-SSO-Attack-2.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Uber-SSO-Attack-2.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Uber-SSO-Attack-2.png\u0026amp;response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSFCZ3AEE%2F20201229%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026amp;X-Amz-Date=20201229T045935Z\u0026amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJFMEMCIHWigdtf4V6jrDm66WbPrvAwAjkDkGwq6jJxHgkhTBQkAh8Pm59QJ1DW90Nm%2BqUZrqPeSIGh%2B3OcvgtVLmg10uTMKrQDCFQQARoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwfS9%2FiGaxXJhRExaMqkQM%2FioQKCRd2GEb49HBlLXjeVg1H%2FoNlCjm1k0hMZ2xM%2B0x4lmIPMnshxiw4gyq5WOKYTVNGzovcoxlJKVWJ0J8ot8jIAdBOEwL1e8YBnNwskpBMy96aUxeRhk0v3RC6PmoKg5jI4Qx3q41XFLoVNJzGZBMLXknGm%2FL%2F3r3TBQO0a%2Bho9Lw4jX%2FmwWvHj8d64twZuZ4naqUS%2FC5%2FMe%2BCb7di7nj2LrLyNCU3mwVZhuZqaKYU7%2BmpmzDXhPe6vg3i0Ag1ETmf%2B4HHFKIzD1arTf4NVMuk53Qk2BUuVm8UMmZQPvicVaLBXLt7ccHpSlZil%2FS4s09xyNkmhqsb4joFjYvki4ZCYJgj6f2HgZ9j5I5jB%2BkNBEx91sV072LTXsJZGus5vwgFqmgq6%2FLSGoCBv5WZ1%2FGuoZfgjyzvsmoBX8uKpu1MK2cCSfK2OOw%2BdQcJ893qtedMSb3E%2FljNUxJf3ge6DsNwKlGjDwu7tV2CwK5eoC8nnGnfgTFitfIQRa0%2BQ7r2Yiwaq1V%2FfpNlnllKKKKFFDD1uar%2FBTrtAcWSVbs%2BpUxv20hwqIlkNrNvMi6wkgf%2BLXOkTSYmrhZJiEvr012n0TMdj9Lpp5lSBvt%2BFmQOWfNxpY3OJBDwcWAiZ%2F2ed9lHQZ21qGQ3nsQfbuRvBliy0SDSXu3rFk%2F2YIvbptRB1WpaAx7N%2FhS0S%2Bs17TOirrod7lqA3UzbN3XBtY1r%2BegR7%2FcG%2BpTuKL1SZFmW4odML8bsKnPb2rSlOtAfW6UI5KEpZRuNPIpftSdXrAErjdLnGLehSWx7Q2Iysd3y2wS8%2BnA6TfU%2Fr7xOl0wvkOaOhwXKDLm%2BA5oHA3Mxg%2F%2FTNCq8BPNgEALt%2FQ%3D%3D\u0026amp;X-Amz-Signature=8f3ceb5fab5c64b4131483ee98d8cd10ba9ca622bdfa4d7443c4f1b74c842e17\" data-attachment-type=\"image/png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/202/677/c44875a3e29f210f07cd737b9cbb377a7d94ec44/Uber-SSO-Attack-2.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Uber-SSO-Attack-2.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Uber-SSO-Attack-2.png\u0026amp;response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSFCZ3AEE%2F20201229%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026amp;X-Amz-Date=20201229T045935Z\u0026amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJFMEMCIHWigdtf4V6jrDm66WbPrvAwAjkDkGwq6jJxHgkhTBQkAh8Pm59QJ1DW90Nm%2BqUZrqPeSIGh%2B3OcvgtVLmg10uTMKrQDCFQQARoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwfS9%2FiGaxXJhRExaMqkQM%2FioQKCRd2GEb49HBlLXjeVg1H%2FoNlCjm1k0hMZ2xM%2B0x4lmIPMnshxiw4gyq5WOKYTVNGzovcoxlJKVWJ0J8ot8jIAdBOEwL1e8YBnNwskpBMy96aUxeRhk0v3RC6PmoKg5jI4Qx3q41XFLoVNJzGZBMLXknGm%2FL%2F3r3TBQO0a%2Bho9Lw4jX%2FmwWvHj8d64twZuZ4naqUS%2FC5%2FMe%2BCb7di7nj2LrLyNCU3mwVZhuZqaKYU7%2BmpmzDXhPe6vg3i0Ag1ETmf%2B4HHFKIzD1arTf4NVMuk53Qk2BUuVm8UMmZQPvicVaLBXLt7ccHpSlZil%2FS4s09xyNkmhqsb4joFjYvki4ZCYJgj6f2HgZ9j5I5jB%2BkNBEx91sV072LTXsJZGus5vwgFqmgq6%2FLSGoCBv5WZ1%2FGuoZfgjyzvsmoBX8uKpu1MK2cCSfK2OOw%2BdQcJ893qtedMSb3E%2FljNUxJf3ge6DsNwKlGjDwu7tV2CwK5eoC8nnGnfgTFitfIQRa0%2BQ7r2Yiwaq1V%2FfpNlnllKKKKFFDD1uar%2FBTrtAcWSVbs%2BpUxv20hwqIlkNrNvMi6wkgf%2BLXOkTSYmrhZJiEvr012n0TMdj9Lpp5lSBvt%2BFmQOWfNxpY3OJBDwcWAiZ%2F2ed9lHQZ21qGQ3nsQfbuRvBliy0SDSXu3rFk%2F2YIvbptRB1WpaAx7N%2FhS0S%2Bs17TOirrod7lqA3UzbN3XBtY1r%2BegR7%2FcG%2BpTuKL1SZFmW4odML8bsKnPb2rSlOtAfW6UI5KEpZRuNPIpftSdXrAErjdLnGLehSWx7Q2Iysd3y2wS8%2BnA6TfU%2Fr7xOl0wvkOaOhwXKDLm%2BA5oHA3Mxg%2F%2FTNCq8BPNgEALt%2FQ%3D%3D\u0026amp;X-Amz-Signature=8f3ceb5fab5c64b4131483ee98d8cd10ba9ca622bdfa4d7443c4f1b74c842e17\" class=\"markdown-inline-image\" style=\"display: inline-block\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"poc\"\u003ePoC\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the PoC below, the assumption is made that \u003ca title=\"https://saostatic.uber.com\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsaostatic.uber.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://saostatic.uber.com\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is actually serving a valid certificate in the victim\u0026#39;s browser, which currently is not the case (so there is currently no actual exposed risk).

The fact that identities supplied to Service Providers by the Identity Provider are communicated via shared *.uber.com cookies make them susceptible for all vulnerabilities that allows insight in cookies on any *.uber.com subdomain. This includes remote code execution, subdomain takeover,  debug logs, etc and has a very serious impact on Uber\u0026#39;s overall security, even when the subdomain is hosted in a completely isolated environment. \nFor example, all the mentioned out of scope *.uber.com subdomains in the program\u0026#39;s listing (bizblog.uber.com, newsroom.uber.com etc) have the inherent ability to bypass authentication of any Uber user, even though they might be remotely managed by an external party with lower security standards than Uber. Ironically enough, any service that wants to benefit from the current Uber SSO system will have to receive a *.uber.com subdomain, as this is required by design. This in its turn increases the attack surface for abuse of the generic Authentication Bypass. \nOn the short term I would recommend fixing the fact that the \u0026quot;_csid\u0026quot; cookie can remain alive in a browser once a user is already logged in (although \u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwhitton.io%2Farticles%2Fuber-turning-self-xss-into-good-xss%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJack Whitton already showed that CSP could be abused to prevent a victim to make the request back to the Service Provider and invalidate the token\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, so I wouldn\u0026#39;t put too much trust in that). On the mid-to-long term I would advise Uber to migrate to a real OAuth SSO system that communicates identity secrets and proofs by other means than shared cookies, e.g. GET parameters (OAuth \u0026quot;code\u0026quot; flow) or window.location.hash values (e.g. OAuth \u0026quot;access tokens\u0026quot; flow). \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet me know if anything is

When Identity Provider auth.uber.com issues a valid shared \"_csid\" cookie token for a Service Provider, store the IP address of the visitor who requested the \"_csid\" on the server-side database. Every Service Provider should then always verify that the visitor who's trying to authenticate with a \"_csid\" cookie has the same IP address as the original requesting visitor of this cookie from auth.uber.com against the server-side database. \n\nI have seen similar countermeasure implementations on SSO systems which use shared session cookies to communicate identities. This would prevent the session relay attack which I described partially: only when an attacker and a victim have the same external IP address, the relay attack I described above could still work. The risk is thus not fully mitigated and I would still recommend migrating to a SSO system which does not rely on shared session cookies at all. However, as a temporary countermeasure, this would already reduce the current risk greatly. Note that IP spoofing (e.g. via [HTTP Header \"X-Forwarded-For\"](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/11/anatomy-of-attack-how-i-hacked.html)) should also be impossible.\n\nCheers,\n\nArne \n\n\n","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi Uber,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSure, take your time and let me know if you have any additional questions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to add one other remark: In order to reduce the current risk of Authentication Bypass via session hijacking, you could already do the following.

Let me know if you'd like to keep the saostatic.uber.com subdomain on Cloudfront, I'll release asap in that case.\n\nCould you elaborate on your decision to not address the SSO issue? Maybe I have not been clear with the attack scenario, but it's **exactly** the same as the typical OAuth attack you describe, only on *.uber.com instead of on one single subdomain:\n1. Victim logs in on any *.uber.com domain via auth.uber.com\n2. Victim visits a website partly under the control of the attacker in another tab (e.g. a purchased ad on a popular website such as youtube.com or even *.uber.com, a waterhole attack)\n3. Attacker can now stealthily generate and steal session cookies for any *.uber.com site on behalf of the victim. That means riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com, bonjour.uber.com, developer.uber.com, ...\n\nIn my opinion, it's not extremely unlikely or convoluted. It's literally the same attack as the OAuth redirect you describe, except this attack can be performed on all *.uber.com subdomains, not just one for which the redirect_uri is not strictly checked. [Other](http://thehackernews.com/2016/04/microsoft-bug-bounty.html) [bug](http://blog.mish.re/index.php/2017/04/29/yahoo-bug-bounty-chaining-3-minor-issues-to-takeover-flickr-accounts/) [bounty](https://hackerone.com/reports/110467 ) [programs](https://stephensclafani.com/2017/03/21/stealing-messenger-com-login-nonces/) have estimated this as high/critical risk. Could you elaborate why you see this differently, and make a CVSS score calculation on your end as well? \n\nIn general, I believe the current SSO system should really be replaced to standard OAuth on the long term for the following reasons:\n- Its flaws are impossible to mitigate, they are here by design and they will always stay. In a hardened OAuth system where redirect_uri's are properly checked (no wildcards for subdomains or paths) and you only use site-specific authentication codes instead of tokens, there are very few possible attacks. Standard OAuth 2 libraries support all of this out of the box. \n- The current system encourages to put anything under \\*.uber.com, to leverage the SSO. This increases the attack surface by design. From a risk point of view, it would not make any sense to exclude \\*.uber.com from your bug bounty program, as a compromise of any \\*.uber.com subdomain may result in the aforementioned Authentication Bypass for **any** uber.com subdomain asset for your [40 million monthly active users](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/uber-statistics/). \n\nLast but not least, I was also hoping that I could publicly disclose this issue once it's been resolved, as it's a great example of the inherent risks of an SSO system based on shared cookies. But of course, if you're not planning on resolving this, I'm not sure if you would be supportive of that. Let me know what your stance is on this (I won't give you trouble, no matter the outcome). \n\nArne\nhttps://www.arneswinnen.net","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi \u003ca href=\"/fletcher\"\u003e@fletcher\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for the feedback.

I can confirm the DNS CNAME record has been removed and the subdomain takeover threat is mitigated. Here are my final two cents on the SSO discussion:\n\nI can confirm that when logging in to mail.google.com and then browsing to keep.google.com, there is no hidden redirect via accounts.google.com (their SSO). However, when doing it the other way around, there is (https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=mail, which redirects back to mail.google.com with several OAuth-like tokens through some GET parameters). This is because Google only relies on the shared session cookie for their non-critical services, but they have a \"proper\" OAuth-like SSO re-authentication for their critical subdomains (drive.google.com as well, for example). Based on your [treasure map](https://eng.uber.com/bug-bounty/), these would be riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com and vault.uber.com for Uber (and maybe some others). \n\nI also don't fully understand your argument. In Uber's current implementation, if you first login to riders.uber.com and then go to partners.uber.com, you will be redirected via auth.uber.com. The real issue is that the identity is communicated via shared session cookies which are by design shared with *.uber.com and thus more vulnerable for theft, unlike GET parameters in hardcoded redirects. \n\nI have tested **many** SSO implementations, and have found it much more difficult to compromise a decently configured OAuth SSO system with hardcoded redirect_uri's and only the \"code\" authorization flow, instead of a full shared SSO session cookie system. No open redirect vulnerability will aid in exploitation of a properly configured OAuth flow anymore: [modifying the redirect_uri to an open redirect endpoint on the same domain these days prevents exchanging a \"code\" for an \"access token\"](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow#exchangecode) and thus yields the attacker nothing:\n\u003e redirect_uri. This argument is required and must be the same as the original request_uri that you used when starting the OAuth login process.\n\nYou can test this by simply changing/appending one character to an original redirect_uri when performing a \"Login with Facebook\" OAuth code flow. It will not work anymore, this attack you speak of has been mitigated universally a while ago. Google, Linkedin and other major players have the same technique implemented at this moment. All self-respecting OAuth libraries have this functionality built-in as well (the good ones have it enabled by default). \n\nAs far for UX and HttpOnly attributes on any session cookies, I don't see any difference between the two SSO options. The current auth.uber.com implementation has the HttpOnly attribute set on all issued temporary session cookies, but this didn't prevent the attack. \n\nHowever, I would still completely understand that you don't want to go through all the effort of changing the SSO system because of this, and accept this inherent risk. In that case, I do believe this should yield the following consequences:\n- Any vulnerability on an \\*.uber.com subdomain that yields visibility into incoming cookies with the Secure and HttpOnly attributes set (not XSS, but e.g. subdomain takeover, debug logs exposure, RCE, ...) would have a high/critical impact. The attack and PoC video I supplied shows that the attack scenario is exactly the same as for theft of an OAuth access token, except that this works for *any* \\*.uber.com subdomain (riders, partners, vault, ...) as opposed to just one in a typical OAuth exploit scenario. It's very similar to many recent [other](http://thehackernews.com/2016/04/microsoft-bug-bounty.html) [bug](http://blog.mish.re/index.php/2017/04/29/yahoo-bug-bounty-chaining-3-minor-issues-to-takeover-flickr-accounts/) [bounty](https://hackerone.com/reports/110467) [program]( https://stephensclafani.com/2017/03/21/stealing-messenger-com-login-nonces/ ) submissions I also mentioned before, just worse for Uber. \n- Based on the aforementioned point, it would not make any sense anymore to exclude any \\*.uber.com subdomain from your bug bounty program's scope, as they carry an inherent high/critical risk should they be compromised (most notably \\*.dev.uber.com, \\*.et.uber.com, bizblog.uber.com, newsroom.uber.com, love.uber.com, drive.uber.com, eng.uber.com, people.uber.com, ...). Especially the first two seem problematic to me. \n\nIf you opt to keep the current SSO system (which, again, I would completely understand from a pragmatic ROI perspective), I would however still advice to implement the check I mentioned in a comment. This would **greatly** reduce the exposed current risk:\n\u003eI wanted to add one other remark: In order to reduce the current risk of Authentication Bypass via session hijacking, you could already do the following. When Identity Provider auth.uber.com issues a valid shared \"_csid\" cookie token for a Service Provider, store the IP address of the visitor who requested the \"_csid\" on the server-side database. Every Service Provider should then always verify that the visitor who's trying to authenticate with a \"_csid\" cookie has the same IP address as the original requesting visitor of this cookie from auth.uber.com against the server-side database.\n\n\u003eI have seen similar countermeasure implementations on SSO systems which use shared session cookies to communicate identities. This would prevent the session relay attack which I described partially: only when an attacker and a victim have the same external IP address, the relay attack I described above could still work. The risk is thus not fully mitigated and I would still recommend migrating to a SSO system which does not rely on shared session cookies at all. However, as a temporary countermeasure, this would already reduce the current risk greatly. Note that IP spoofing (e.g. via HTTP Header \"X-Forwarded-For\") should also be impossible.\n\nLooking forward to your response. By any means, if you fundamentally disagree with any of my arguments or anything is unclear, let me know.\n\nArne\n\n\n","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi \u003ca href=\"/fletcher\"\u003e@Fletcher\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for your extensive feedback, much appreciated.

When Identity Provider auth.uber.com issues a valid shared \u0026quot;_csid\u0026quot; cookie token for a Service Provider, store the IP address of the visitor who requested the \u0026quot;_csid\u0026quot; on the server-side database. Every Service Provider should then always verify that the visitor who\u0026#39;s trying to authenticate with a \u0026quot;_csid\u0026quot; cookie has the same IP address as the original requesting visitor of this cookie from auth.uber.com against the server-side database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have seen similar countermeasure implementations on SSO systems which use shared session cookies to communicate identities. This would prevent the session relay attack which I described partially: only when an attacker and a victim have the same external IP address, the relay attack I described above could still work. The risk is thus not fully mitigated and I would still recommend migrating to a SSO system which does not rely on shared session cookies at all. However, as a temporary countermeasure, this would already reduce the current risk greatly. Note that IP spoofing (e.g. via HTTP Header \u0026quot;X-Forwarded-For\u0026quot;) should also be impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking forward to your response.
