However, if the process is proxied through torsocks(1) or proxychains(1), which resolves onion addresses into a loopback address that is handled by them internally, `is_local_address` will return `true` on such address, while the actual node should be considered untrusted.\n\nThis issue may sound trivial and I also noticed a new argument `--untrusted-daemon` has been added in commit [c4907d24cb32129ee52a53711547c5d54960c431](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/commit/c4907d24cb32129ee52a53711547c5d54960c431), but not all users using a remote node with torsocks or proxychains are aware of this. Essentially, we can't really tell if the address is really local, and current judgement of it doesn't make a sufficient condition that the daemon can be trusted.\n\n## Releases Affected:\n* Monero CLI wallet (@master)\n* Monero GUI wallet (@master)\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n1. Run the CLI wallet with `torsocks monero-wallet-cli --daemon-address zdhkwneu7lfaum2p.onion:18099`\n1. Authenticate the wallet and sync.\n1. Send command `rescan_bc`, which should be available only if the daemon is trusted.\n1. The command executed successfully.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\nNone\n\n## Possible Solutions:\n1. Add an extra condition in src/common/util.cpp function is_local_address to judge if the daemon address ends with .onion or .i2p etc..\n1.
