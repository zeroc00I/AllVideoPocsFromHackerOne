Allowing lists to be invoiced is core functionality of our service. Furthermore, it's not necessary to use \"Burp Suite Intruder\" in the manner demonstrated here. The functionality is exposed more directly in an intentional fashion over our API: \n\nhttps://coinbase.com/api/doc/1.0/transactions/request_money.html\n\nThis process simply sends an email with a request. It does not initiate any bitcoin transfer without confirmation from the recipient, and would not be any more effective than more traditional phishing methods, which we spend a considerable amount of time preventing.\n\n# Email Address / User enumeration on Coinbase\n\nWe've spent a good amount of time investigating this behavior and we believe that the risks are incredibly minor.
