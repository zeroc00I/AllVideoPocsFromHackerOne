If a user has logged in Digits, a website can use this method to get the user's OAuth credentials instead of asking him to authorize it. The way it works is to embed an iframe (https://www.digits.com/bridge) onto a web page, and communicate with the web page through *postMessage()*. Currently, there is a security check in place which prevents a website to call this method with other app's key by making sure the HTTP Referer is the registered domain. The protection works because embedding an iframe involves sending the *Referer* header in the request. If app A wants to call the method and pretend itself as app B, it won't work because the *Referer* header is from app A instead of the registered domain of app B.\n\nHowever, It was found that if the *Referer* header is left empty, the validation will also think this is valid. The problem is that there is a way for a website to disable sending *Referer* for out bound requests by using the tag `\u003cmeta name=\"referrer\" content=\"never\"\u003e`.
