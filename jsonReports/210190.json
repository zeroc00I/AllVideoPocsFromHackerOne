Create a private program in HackerOne\n2. Invite hackers/researchers to participate\n3. In the program settings page, browse to Hacker Management -\u003e Message Hackers and send a message to \"All hackers who have submitted a report to your program\" containing new bounty information meant for just those members of your private program\"\n4. Update the program scope to include information about the targeted bounty that was previously messaged to hackers\n5. Run your private program as planned\n6. When ready to take the program live, remove the targeted private bounty details from the program scope  \n7. Launch the program public by going to Hacker Management-\u003e Invite Hackers, then selecting the option to take the program public.  Click through the prompts to successfully publish the program.\n8. Browse to https://hackerone.com/\u003cINSERT PROGRAM\u003e/update and find the message sent to the select hackers during the private program now publicly accessible.  \n","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTransitioning a private program to public does not clear the previously private updates to hackers \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription (Include Impact):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are managing a private bug bounty program and choose to message hackers in the program with a targeted bounty campaign or other limited / private messaging, then when you take the program public that messaging will not be removed from program update page located at  \u003ca title=\"https://hackerone.com/\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/\"\u003ehttps://hackerone.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u0026lt;INSERT PROGRAM\u0026gt;/updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI observed this in the wild while transitioning the Rockstar Games program to being public.
