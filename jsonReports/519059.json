Log in to an account with unprotected tweets on the Android app.\n  1. Log in to the same account on mobile.twitter.com and turn on protected tweets.\n  1. Confirm that the account's tweets are protected.\n  1. In the Android app, go to the Direct Messages tab, click the gear icon and change a setting such as \"Receive message requests\" or \"Show read receipts.\"\n  1. The account's tweets are now unprotected.\n\nIf this does not work, you may have to first explicitly unset the protected tweets setting in the Android app before setting it elsewhere.\n\n## Impact:\n\nThis can cause a user's tweets to unknowingly become public.
