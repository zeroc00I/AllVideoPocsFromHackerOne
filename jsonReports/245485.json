This issue could allow XSS via Cookie, bypass Double Submit Cookie csrf protection or Session Fixation on .█████████ domains web apps.\n\n**Description:**\nA CRLF Injection attack occurs when an attacker manages to submit a CRLF into an application. \nThese two special characters represent the End of Line (EOL) marker for many internet protocols, including HTTP. Web applications typically split headers based on where the CRLF character sequence is found. Therefore, if a malicious user is able to inject their own CRLF sequence into an HTTP stream, they gain control over the contents of the HTTP response.\nIn this case this is could be done by modifying an HTTP request directed to the \"███\" adding, for example, the following payload:\n\n\u003e %0D%0ASet-Cookie:test2=test;domain=.████\n\nWith the preceding payload, an attacker is going to set, on the victim's browser that is visiting the malicious URL, a new cookie with an arbitrary value.
