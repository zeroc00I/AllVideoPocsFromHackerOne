Reputation signal is based on average of reputation per closed report so likely less than 7? Impact however is determined by average bounty which is 25 or 50 or less depending on bounty. So I believe this should not hurt your signal/reputation. Correct me if I am wrong on this. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThank you.
